# Tableau Conference 2025 Proposal
I'm writing a proposal for my talk at the Tableau Conference 2025. Attached file is a documentation of my work. Based on that content, I want you to help me draft the following questions from a form I'm filling

1 - Proposed Title (maximum 60 characters)
Integrating Version Control and VS Code into Tableau Workflows

2 - Proposed Abstract (maximum 200 characters)
Learn to integrate Git and VS Code into Tableau workflows for seamless collaboration, version control, and enhanced visualizations.

3 - Why should this session be presented at Tableau Conference? (maximum 1000 characters)
This session offers a solution to a common challenge faced by Tableau users: managing collaboration and version control for Tableau workbooks and Tableau Prep flows. While Tableau's native tools provide revision history, they do not support modern version control systems like Git. This session introduces a scripting method that extracts .twb and .tfl files into plain text, making it possible to track changes, identify diffs, and manage versions in a way familiar to software developers. Attendees will gain practical knowledge of integrating Git into their Tableau workflows, reducing manual errors, and improving team collaboration on large-scale Tableau-related projects. This solution is especially relevant for intermediate to advanced users who want to scale their projects and align with enterprise-level best practices. By presenting this session, we aim to empower Tableau analysts with the tools to streamline their workflows and ensure visualization integrity.

4 - You selected Data Analyst as your primary audience. You also indicated that the session level is for intermediate Tableau users. What are three learning objectives attendees will achieve by participating in your session?
* Learning Objective 1: Understand how to convert Tableau workbooks and Tableau Prep flows into text format using a Bash script.
* Learning Objective 2: Master the basics of a Git workflow to track changes, manage versions, and enhance team collaboration on large-scale Tableau projects.
* Learning Objective 3: Discover best practices for integrating modern tools like VS Code and Git into Tableau workflows. 

---

To strengthen your proposal, consider:
* Demonstrating a real-world example or case study where this script solved a practical problem.
* Highlighting how the script simplifies processes like peer reviews, rollback to previous versions, and managing team contributions.
* Offering a brief comparison with existing solutions (e.g., Tableau Server revision history or Python-based tools).
